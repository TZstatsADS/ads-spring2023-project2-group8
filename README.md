# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

Term: Spring 2023

![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **NYC government agency/program** of your choice using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, many agencies have adjusted their work or rolled out new programs due to COVID, your app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how covid has impacted daily life in NYC from different prospectives. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: In this project, we developed a shiny app on NYC housing. In this app, we track the effect of covid-19 on housing from 3 dimensions:
Distribution of housing units(number of bedrooms) of newly built houses
Trend of NYC housing for people of different income levels
Trend and distribution of NYC housing maintenance 

+ **Data source** :

NYC Open data: Affordable Housing Production by Building (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Affordable-Housing-Production-by-Building/hg8x-zxpr)

NYC Open data: Housing Maintenance Code Complaints (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Maintenance-Code-Complaints/uwyv-629c)

+ **Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) All team members designed the study. Qi Yixuan built the framework of the overall project code and deployed the app. She also resolved commit conflicts and helped team members fix the code. For the detalied parts, Qi Yixuan and Li Yuanxi wrote the page of distribution of housing units. Ren Xiaoxue and Huang zhi wrote the page of trend of NYC housing for people of different income levels. Tang Qingyang and Zhang Zixun wrote the 2 pages of trend and distribution of NYC housing maintenance respectively. Tang QingYang also wrote the homepage and appendix. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
